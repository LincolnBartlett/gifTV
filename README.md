gifTV is a simple React application that pulls JSON from subreddits and displays posts without the clutter. Currently the applicaion is read only and designed to work best with subbreddits that are focused on GIFs.

The file structure is divied into two main folders, server and client. Their functions should be self-explanatory.
##Server
An express application serving the production build files from the client folder. 
##Client
The development files for the React application.
